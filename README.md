# Cool scripts

Here you can find some of my usefull scripts.

These ones require *dmenu*:

First script manages monitors via *xrandr*. It should be binded
somewhere to be easily accessed to. (Find it in *monitor.awk*)

Second one is simple usb daemon which helps you to *mount* your
hard drives, flash drives and so on. You should enable it on startup.
This usb daemon cannot unmount your devices, so you need to use script
*usb/umount.awk* manually (bind it somewhere for easy access).
(Look in *usb* directory for more information)

Third one is just cool thing that downloads and sets some reddit
pictures as ur wallpaper with *feh*. It downloads them to
*$TOPDIR/res*. (Actually doesnt require *dmenu*)
