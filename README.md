# Cool scripts

Here you can find some of my usefull scripts.

These ones require *dmenu*:

First script manages monitors via *xrandr*. It should be binded
somewhere to be easily accessed to. (Find it in *monitor.awk*)

Second one is simple usb daemon which helps you to *mount* your
hard drives, flash drives and so on. You should enable it on startup.
(Look in *usb* directory)
